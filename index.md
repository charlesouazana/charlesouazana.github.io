## About me ([resume](https://charlesouazana.github.io/Resume.pdf))

I created Nomad, a crypto startup which aims to reduce fees from intermediaries using cryptocurrencies as a payment method

I am also a strong chess player, ranking in the top 10% on the [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/charlesouaza1998) in the rapid cadence.

Previously, I did a classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles d'ingénieurs (PSI*), then studied mathematics and AI at l'École des Mines and at l'Université Jean Monnet. 

I also enjoy doing research in AI and I have previously work on projects such as Hurricane Forecasting, Medical image synthesis and an Algorithmic trading strategy.
